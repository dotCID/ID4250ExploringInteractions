The arduinoConnections JPEGs show how the pin headers of the prototype should be connected.
All other documentation should be in the code.
I am aware that this code is not up to par with the standards of class separation; I have experienced problems in earlier projects with proper class separation and the Arduino and thus have deliberately chosen for a godclass.

The latest version of the code is to be found in swipeFridgeMonsterClass3.cpp. It requires the CapacitiveSensing library to function; it can be found in the Arduino repositories at the following location:
http://playground.arduino.cc//Main/CapacitiveSensor

Feel free to (re)use any part of this, as long as you give me credit where it's due.
